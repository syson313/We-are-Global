Research Topic: Predicting Heart Attack Risk Using BMI

Introduction and Purpose of the Study

Heart attack, or myocardial infarction, is a condition where the heart muscle is deprived of blood flow, leading to tissue necrosis and potentially causing cardiac arrest and death. In 2024, heart disease ranked as the second leading cause of death among South Koreans, with an increasing number of fatalities attributed to it. Missing the critical "golden hour" of approximately 4 minutes can significantly increase the likelihood of death, highlighting the need for early diagnosis to assess the risk of heart disease.
Recent studies, such as the report indicating that prolonged obesity can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases by up to 60%, demonstrate the influence of factors like BMI, smoking status, and alcohol consumption on heart health. This study aims to model a predictive system that assesses the risk of heart disease based on BMI and other relevant factors. By utilizing this modeling approach, individuals can take proactive measures against heart disease, potentially leading to a significant reduction in the number of related fatalities.
